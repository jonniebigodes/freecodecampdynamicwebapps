# Freecodecamp Dynamic webapps



This repository contains the implementation of the Dynamic webapps challenges for freecodecamp.
The challenges are the following
  - [Build a Voting App]
  - [Build a Nightlife coordination app]
  - [Chart the Stock Market]
  - [Manage a Book Trading Club]
  - Build a Pinrest Clone

# Methodology used
Instead of creating a single repo for each challenge and as i'm familiar with github i condensed the dynamic  challenges in one package/repo.  
As it's not in direct contradiction of the rules and/or objectives.
In terms of development methodology i used the following folder structure:
  - /controllers/
    - This folder contains the controllers for all the challenges
  - /src/
    - This folder contains all the view implementation and also the routing logic used.
      And also the logic applied to the server interactions. 
  - /src/Assets/
    - This folder contains the stylesheets and other types of media.
  - /src/client/components/challenges/
    - Inside this folder are the components i.e views used for the challenges.
  - /src/client/mockData/
    - This folder contains the implementation of some mock data for testing purposes.
  - /src/server/
    - This folder contains the the bits that are external to the application.
  - /dist/
    - This folder contains the release(aka build files).
  - /src/common/actions
    - This folder is the placeholder for redux actions defined for the challenges.
  - /src/common/api
    - This folder is the placeholder for external calls, namely rest calls to the server for the various challenges.
 - /src/common/constants
    - This folder is the placeholder for defining the constants(i.e action types) for the challenges.
  - /src/common/reducers
    - This folder is the placeholder for the redux reducers for the challenges
  - /src/common/store
    - This folder is the placeholder for the redux stores for the challenges 
    
### Tech

This set of challenges uses a number of open source projects to work properly:
* [React] - Great Javascript library for Building user interfaces
* [React-Redux] - Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
* [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
* [Express] - fast node.js network app framework 
* [Webpack] - fast packaging framework for deployment
* [Mongodb] - Best of relational with the innovations of NOSQL
* [Material-UI] - Google inspired material design framework
* [whatwg-fetch]- A Promise-based mechanism for programatically making web requests in the browser, 
                    cause bad..bad move to try and get stuff from mongo directly from client code, that's the server responsability right kids?
* [React-Chart] - A react wrapper for [Chart2] library.
* [yelp-fusion] - Yelp Fusion API client for Node.js with Promises
* [Twitter-Client] - Twitter client package in order to be possible sharing some information in some challenges
* [PASSPORT] - Authentication middleware for node(added normal passport and it's social variants twitter and facebook)

And of course the implementation of the challenges themselves are open source with a [git-repo-url]
 on GitHub.

### Installation from source

freecodecamp api  requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v4+ to run.

Download and extract the [latest pre-built release](https://github.com/jonniebigodes/freecodecampdynamicwebapps/releases).

Define a .env file to contain your environment variables like the one bellow.
### Environment variable list for the app to work

Bellow is a list of environment variables needed for the app to funcion correctly:
- /PROD_MONGODB/
    - Your remote mongoDB server instance connection string
- /QUANDL_KEY/
    - The api key provided by [Quandl], this because upon some research i found out that this company has a well documented api and easy to use and it's data is accurate. 
- /YELP_CONSUMER_KEY/
    - Go to [YELP] and get your free key to use with the app.
- /YELP_CONSUMER_SECRET/
    - This is provided by the item above.
- /TWITTER_APP_KEY/
    - Go to [Twitter] and access their development section and create an app and get your key.
- /TWITTER_APP_SECRET/
    - This is generated by completing the above item.
- /SESSION_HASH/
    - Generate a hash wherever, locally or online, there are quite a bit of resources for this, this will be used by [Passport] .
- /BLUEAPIKEY/
    - Go to [BLUESEND] and create an account to use when sending email notifications for the books challenge.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server like the example bellow shows
```sh
$ cd folder to contain the app
$ npm install 
$ npm start

Open url http://localhost:5000
```
