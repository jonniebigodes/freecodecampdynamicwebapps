# freecodecamp Dynamic webapps



This repository contains the implementation of the Dynamic webapps challenges for freecodecamp.
The challenges are the following
  - Build a Voting App
  - Build a Nightlife coordination app
  - Chart the Stock Market
  - Manage a Book Trading Club
  - Build a Pinrest Clone

# Methodology used
Instead of creating a single repo for each challenge and as i'm familiar with github i condensed the api challenges in one package/repo.
As it's not in direct contradiction of the rules and/or objective.
In terms of development methodology i used the following:
  
  - /src/
    - this folder contains all the view implementation and also the routing logic used. 
  - /src/Challenges/
    - This folder contains the logic bits for the challenges that required some extra logic used.
  - /src/Challenges/components
    - Inside this folder are the components i.e views used for the challenges
  - /dist/
    - This folder contains the release(aka build files).
  



### Tech

this set of challenges uses a number of open source projects to work properly:
* [React] - Great Javascript library for Building user interfaces
* [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
* [Express] - fast node.js network app framework 
* [Webpack] - fast packaging framework for deployment
* [Mongodb] - Best of relational with the innovations of NOSQL

And of course the implementation of the challenges themselves are open source with a [git-repo-url]
 on GitHub.
